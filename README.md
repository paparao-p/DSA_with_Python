# DSA Practice with Python:

This repository contains my daily practice of Data Structures and Algorithms problems using Python, mainly from platform like LeetCode.

I focus on solving problems by patterns such as Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Binary Search, Stack, etc., and documenting each solution with:

- Problem description
- Approach
- Time & Space Complexity
- Clean implementation

## Progress Tracker:
- Two Pointers:

  - Two Sum II – Input Array Is Sorted (LC 167)
  - Valid Palindrome (LC 125)
  - Move Zeroes (LC 283)
 
## Language & Tools:
- Python
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub

## Platforms Used:
- LeetCode

## How I Practice:

- Pick a pattern/topic for the day.
- Solve 1–3 problems.
- Optimize solutions.
- Push to GitHub with clean commits.
- Update this README with progress.
